> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Prefect is a Python-native workflow orchestration tool for building, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines with fault tolerance. Prefect provides a hybrid execution model where the cloud control plane coordinates workflows while code and data remain in customer infrastructure, offering both a managed cloud platform and a self-hosted open-source server.

## APIs

### Prefect Cloud REST API

The Prefect Cloud REST API provides programmatic access to Prefect Cloud for orchestrating and managing workflows, deployments, flow runs, task runs, artifacts, and automations. The API follows RESTful conventions with pluralized collection names, snake_case route names, and supports an OpenAPI 3.0 compliant specification. Clients authenticate using API keys passed as Bearer tokens in request headers.

### Prefect Server REST API

The Prefect Server REST API is the self-hosted variant of the Prefect orchestration API for managing workflows, flow runs, task runs, deployments, and work pools. When running Prefect server locally, the API is available at http://localhost:4200/api and interactive documentation is served at the /docs endpoint. The API can be fully described with an OpenAPI 3.0 compliant document generated from the running server.

### Prefect Python SDK

The Prefect Python SDK is used to build, test, and execute workflows against the Prefect API. It provides decorators such as @flow and @task for defining workflows, along with programmatic interfaces for deployments, scheduling, state management, concurrency, caching, and retries. The SDK requires Python 3.10 or higher and includes a PrefectClient class for direct interaction with the REST API.
